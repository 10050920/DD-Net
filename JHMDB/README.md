## 1. Download JHMDB dataset from 
```
http://jhmdb.is.tue.mpg.de/challenge/JHMDB/datasets

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H_-ByZMnLTXvrUzx6XZEuPy7rxX0XENB/view?usp=sharing
please follow their licence to use it and cite their papers.) 
```
(or you can directly use our preprocessed features in /data)
